2. Familiarize with dataset
	- Not all poles are labeled in the datasets e.g. img2071
		* This is model destructive, as the model will get contradictory information on what to find

	LiDAR = 1024 x 128
		* Near-IR maps to blue
		* Signal to green
		* Reflectivity to red.
	
	Real = 1920 x 1208

	Labels are on YOLO format -> [Class label, center x-coordinate, center y-coordinate, width, height]
		* Coordinates create a bounding box
	
	Using albumentations for image augmentations. 
	Applying different augmentations to increase samples space and deepen learning of model. 	
	
	
3. Read up on pretrained models -> Yolo and others

4. Read up on SOTA in Autonomous Driving

5. Decide on model architecture 
	Feature pyramid network -> Giving the "neck" access to different levels of features, meaning features with different level of extraction

	Pytorch RPN handles this:
		- Loss function for object detection??
		- Use non-maximum suppression, only keeping the most confident bboxes
	
	Model architecture schedule:
	1. Pure CNN model
	2. CNN with NN neck: CNN -> RPN -> NN 
	3. CNN with Cooperator neck
	4. CNN/ViM Combination -> Producing half of the channels each, ViM is applied to each CNN output
	5. CNN/ViM with cooperator neck
	6. CNN/ViT Combination?
	7. DETR
	8. Deformable DETR

6. Train a model

7. Set up calculation of evalutaion metrics: 
	- Precision: TP / (TP + FP) -> How many detected objects are correct.
	- Recall: TP / (TP + FN) -> How many real objects were detected.
	– mAP@50 -> Mean Average Precision @ IoU 50
	– mAP@0.5:0.95



NOTES: 
 First model: 
 	Had trouble finding prediction, likely due to the lack of negative boxes
 	LR was to big OR model was to small
 	
 	
Iterative training:
	Gradually increasing the IoU thresholds in order to achieve less sparse data -> some positive samples.
	Starting at low IoU = 0.3, then gradually moving upwards. Training for 100 epochs at each step.
	0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7
