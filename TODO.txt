2. Familiarize with dataset
- Not all poles are labeled in the datasets e.g. img2071
	* This is model destructive, as the model will get contradictory information on what to find

LiDAR = 1024 x 128
	* Near-IR maps to blue
	* Signal to green
	* Reflectivity to red.
	
Real = 1920 x 1208

Labels are on YOLO format -> [Class label, center x-coordinate, center y-coordinate, width, height]
	* Coordinates create a bounding box
	
Using albumenations for image augmentations. 
Applying different augmentations to increase samples space and deepen learning of model. 	
	
	
3. Read up on pretrained models -> Yolo and others

4. Read up on SOTA in Autonomous Driving

5. Decide on model architecture 

6. Train a model

7. Set up calculation of evalutaion metrics: 
- Precision: TP / (TP + FP) -> How many detected objects are correct.
- Recall: TP / (TP + FN) -> How many real objects were detected.
– mAP@50 -> Mean Average Precision @ IoU 50
– mAP@0.5:0.95
